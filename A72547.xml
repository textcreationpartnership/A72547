         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:150422:3"/>
muſt haue done you wrong, as the caſe ſtandeth; for may it pleaſe you to vnderſtand, that being in your Sonnes ſtudie at Grayes Inne (vnto whom for a while I read the French tongue,) he chanced amongſt other bookes to find out the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall of the two laſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of this booke, which in our peruſing, J in my poore iudgement found to be ſuch worthy matters, that I could not content my ſelfe with the reading of them, but bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed the booke of him, and
<pb facs="tcp:150422:3"/>
my waſt times tooke occaſion (as well for my owne further ſatisfaction, as to impart it vnto others, my particular friends,) to tranſlate it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Engliſh tongue, not meaning to haue had it publiſhed in print. Which when your ſaid Son (whom J haue ſtill found to bee a louer of ſuch godly workes) vnderstood, hee was very deſirous to haue it printed, alledging that it could not chuſe but bee verie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb facs="tcp:150422:4"/>
whereunto (although ſomewhat vnwilling in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of my weakneſſe in the performance thereof) yet at laſt I condeſcended, and to amplify the volume, annexed another excellent Treatiſe to comfort the ſicke, written by the ſame Author, which for order ſake I haue placed before the other two, and do preſent them together vnto your Worſhip, as belonging vnto you of right; beſeeching you to take them in as good part as they are willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Eſus Chriſt not without cauſe amongſt thoſe things which he commands vs to require of God in our praiers, doth enioyne vs to demaund that hee leade vs not into temptation: for, regarding on the one ſide the weaknes &amp; infirmity which is in vs, &amp; on the other the enuy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire which the diuell hath of our ruine, the diligence &amp; purſuit which he vſeth to procure it, and finally the ſubtilties, meanes and practiſes that he holds to attaine thereunto, inceſſantly ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for to deuoure vs like vnto a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lyon rauening after his prey: we haue great neede to ſtand vpon our gard, and to watch and pray for to preuent his ambuſcadoes and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, to the end we bee not caught in his nets. And for as much as the laſt aſſaultes which an enemie giues to thoſe that are beſieged, are
<pb facs="tcp:150422:6"/>
ordinarily the hardeſt &amp; moſt furious, we muſt prepare betime, and prouide our ſelues (during our life) of thoſe things which ſhall be neceſſary for vs at our death, for to arme our ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the great aſſaults which then the diuell makes to cary vs away. knowing wel that if he faile at that time the place is loſt for him, and that it behoues him ſhamefully to raiſe his ſiege, without hope to come thither any more. Now the weapons &amp; engins wherewith we ſhould principally furniſh our ſelues, are faith, and the word of God; faith by the which we apprehend the grace of God, and the iuſtice of Ieſus Chriſt, for to ſerue vs for a buckler and target, to couer and defend vs from the flames of the enemy. And the word for to aſſault him vigorouſly, and to caſt him on the ground, as did Ieſus Chriſt. For there are but theſe two means by the which we are able to withſtand or repulſe his aſſaults, and carry away a full victory ouer him. Therfore is it (my brethren)
<pb facs="tcp:150422:6"/>
that I haue gathered you out of the Scripture ſome notes, proper for to comfort &amp; ſtrengthen you againſt the tentations, wherewith you may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted at the point of death. But I pray you not to ſtay till that howre, to take them, &amp; to arme your ſelues with them; doing as do the negligent Captaines, who ſtay to furniſh the places which are committed vnto them, with things needfull for to keepe them, till they are compaſſed and enuironed with men of war, wherby it often hapneth, that fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelues vnprouided of means needfull for to defend themſelues, and ſo finding themſelues aſtonied, they preſently forſake them, &amp; eaſily yeeld vnto the enemy. But by the example of the Ant and the Bee, make your proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in due time and ſeaſon, to the end that when the winter comes you may be wel prouided of all that ſhalbe need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eaſily to paſſe &amp; ſuſtaine the rigor thereof. Aboue all, I pray you to note in the treaty which I ſend you thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:150422:7"/>
which are therein alledged againſt raſhnes and preſumption. For they are the two principall tentations which the diuell ordinarily employeth for to ouerthrow vs: repreſenting before our eyes, either the multitude &amp; greatneſſe of our ſins, for to caſt vs headlong into a miſtruſt of the mercy of God: or our vertues and good works, for to raiſe vs vp vnto preſumption and vaine confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence therin. Theſe are the two ropes (ſaith <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi>) which this torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter doth continually vſe to ſtrangle &amp; ſtifle men with, if they take not heed of him. But it ſhall be eaſie for you to preuent theſe dangers, calling often to minde that which is ſaid in the ſcriptures, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the corruption &amp; vanity of men to humble them, and on the other ſide that which is alſo ſpoken of the great and infinite mercy and grace of God, to aſſure them of their ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I hope that with his helpe, my labour writing vnto you this little Treatiſe, and yours in the reading of it attentiuely, ſhal not be vnprofitable. So be it.</p>

all the deſolations that were ſeene in their Countrey;<note place="margin">Simil.</note> for as the fire produceth fire, and all other things produce or bring forth their like; ſo doth God from whom no euill can come. Yea, but ſickneſſe, famine, pouerty, ſterility, warres, are they not euils which God ſendeth, and ſo is the author of them? God ſends them indeed as well to the good as to the wicked, to the one to puniſh their ſinnes, which is a iuſt &amp; laudable act, to the other to exerciſe their vertue, or to draw and bring them to repentance. And if wee would be good husbands, and appropriate our ſickneſſe well, and referre it to the ends for the which God ſends them vnto vs, wee might gather much fruit, and many good leſſons by it: In the firſt place, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is ſo neceſſary, as to know our ſinnes, and the vice and corruption which is in vs, to humble our ſelues to God, and to diſpoſe our ſelues to require and ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his grace, which is the only meanes by the which they may bee remitted, couered and hidden before him, to auoide his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the condemnation which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhould therein bee prepared for vs, if they were not pardoned vnto vs. Now ſo it is that naturally we are blind in the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we haue of our ſelues, by reaſon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150422:17"/>
that the exceſſiue &amp; vnmeaſured loue which we haue of our ſelues, doth blinde our eies, in ſuch ſort that wee cannot perceiue, nor diſcouer the malice, the hypocriſie, the pride, the vanity, the miſtruſt, the iniuſtice, the impiety, the idolatry, the inhumanity, and all the infinite peruerſity, which from our child-hood is bred in our hearts, and diſcloſeth it ſelfe with the time, according to the occaſions which are preſented vnto vs. For although that we doe all indeauour for a time to hide the malice which we haue conceiued in our hearts,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> like vnto women that deſire to ſteale their children: Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, when the belly comes to ſwell, and that their time of childing drawes neare, they are conſtrained to auouch that which they had alwaies denyed.

infinite number of ſinnes, they cannot ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe know nor feele them, if God doth not giue them the grace to ſet them before their eyes; Which is the reaſon for the which in many paſſages of the Scripture, Penitence (which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſts partly in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and diſpleaſure that man hath of his ſinne) is called the gift of God.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tin.</hi> 2.</note> For as wee cannot know God, nor the goods which we ought to ſeeke for in him, and hope for of his goodneſſe; if firſt we be not inwardly illuminated by his ſpirit, and outwardly taught by his word; Alſo wee cannot well know our ſelues, nor well ſound the vice &amp; euill which is in our hearts, if the ſpirit of God doth not giue vs eies for to behold our ſelues, in the looking glaſſe of his law. For to ſee our ſelues and that which is in vs, we haue no eyes naturally, no more then that old <hi>Lamia,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Compar.</note> who as fables recount had eies which ſhee laid away in her houſe, becauſe ſhee would there ſee nothing, and put them on when ſhee went forth, to ſpie and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue what was done at her neighbours. Whereunto alſo agreeth the fable of <hi>Eſop,</hi> wherein is ſaid that we carry euery man his wallet, in the hinder part whereof we put our owne ſinnes that they may neuer come before our eyes, and in the forepart, the ſins
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150422:19"/>
of our neighbors, to the end that ſeing them we may haue argument to detract &amp; ſpeake euill of them. And it is a meruailous thing that our ſins ſhould be ſuch great and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diſeaſes, and euen mortall, and that notwithſtanding they are ſo litle ſenſible to thoſe that by them are detayned; for we ſee how the Idolaters, hypocrites, ambitious, couetous, and voluptuous men doe ſolace themſelues without ſorrow, not any whit complaining of their euill. Which is more, the Idolater hath neuer more pleaſure, then when he beholds, kiſſes, and worſhips his Idoll; nor the hypocrite is neuer more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, then at ſuch time as by the appearance of ſome counterfait vertue, he can inſinuate himſelfe into ſome good opinion, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the eſtimation and reputation to bee vertuous; &amp; the others neuer eſteeme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more happy then when they peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably enioy the honors, riches, pleaſures of this world, which they deſire; and the cauſe of all this is, that they haue no feeling of their euill, which is ſo much the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. As amongſt the bodily diſeaſes,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> the moſt pernitious are thoſe that bring leaſt paine, as Palſies, Lethargies, Apoplexies, &amp; other cold Catarres, for ſuch diſeaſes are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily incurable; which was cauſe in times

paſt to make an ancient man to ſay, he did well deſire not to be ſicke altogither, but if he were, he deſired alſo to feele his paine: giuing to vnderſtand thereby, that there is nothing more dangerous then to be ſicke, and not to thinke they are ſo. What ſhall then become of vs, who neuer thinke wee are ſo vitious as we are, and alwaies to bee more vertuous then wee are? for wee neuer ballance nor weigh our vices with our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but with falſe weights and falſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; by reaſon that when we weigh our vices we take the ſmal weight, and the great when it is queſtion of our vertues, the which we alwaies thinke to bee greater then they are, by reaſon of this furious loue of our ſelues, the which ſtoppeth our eyes, and blinds our ſight.<note place="margin">Simil.</note> And euen as the vapours and miſts which euening and morning riſe from the earth, being put betweene vs and the Sunne, make it ſeeme greater vnto vs then it is; ſo when we behold our vertues through this loue which couers our eyes, we iudge them alwaies to be more greater and more perfect then they are. What muſt we then doe to correct and amend this falſe iudgement which we haue of our ſelues, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming our ſelues more vertuous and leſſe vicious then we are? we muſt learne to know
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150422:20"/>
our ſelues, and to that end meditate the law of God day and night, referring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, our thoughts, our affections, our wordes, our actions, and in ſumme all the eſtate of our life, as the ſtraight rule, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the which it ought to be meaſured.

who for the great ſhame and horror which hee had of his life paſſed, durſt not life vp his eyes, yet neuertheleſſe preſently when hee had acknowledged his pittifull and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable eſtate wherein hee was, and prayed God to haue pitty on him, then al his ſinnes were forgiuen him, and hee went home iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified?

Who will ſay that hee had any regard to his merit, and to the dignity of his geſtures and actions, when hee raiſed him to ſuch a

degree of honour, and hath done him as much or more fauour then to any of all his fellowes. Seeing that hee himſelfe doth ſo highly magnifie grace whereunto hee attributeth all that hee euer thought, ſaid, or did, that was commendable; It is then the only grace of God that is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and meanes of the life which wee hope for; as it alſo is of iuſtice and holyneſſe, by the which wee attayne it.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:150422:45"/>
and aſſure vs our hope entirely, that it be grounded vpon his mercy and truth, which are firme and immoueable, then vpon the dignitie of our workes and vertues, which are ſo imperfect. Now when yee ſhall ſee the ſicke well reſolued of the remiſſion of all his ſinnes, and that in his heart there ſhall no more remayne any feare of them, that doth any more trouble his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; then you muſt proceede farther, and arme him againſt the horrour and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that hee may haue of death, in ſhewing vnto him out of the word of God, that it hath bene done away, and ſwallowed vp by the death of Ieſus Chriſt, who ſpeaking by the mouth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſayeth to Death,<note place="margin">

For ſeeing that the ſting of death is ſinne, and the power of ſinne is the law, Ieſus Chriſt accompliſhing the law for vs, hath by that meanes taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſting of death; ſo that it can hurt vs no more; And likewiſe broken the power of ſinne, ſo that it can no more condemne vs. And although the decree and ordinance of God beares, that all men muſt die, and that being come out of the duſt, they ſhall returne to duſt againe: neuertheleſſe to ſpeake properly, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:150422:45"/>
of the bodie and the ſoule in the faithfull man, ought not to bee called death. Alſo IESVS CHRIST ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to his Diſciples of <hi>Lazarus,</hi>

                              <hi>Iob.</hi> 11.</note> who was dead, tolde them, that hee ſlept. This manner of ſpeaking is very vſuall in the old Teſtament, to ſignifie the death of the Fathers. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> vſeth it alſo when hee writeth to the Corinthians and Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1. <hi>Theſsa.</hi>
                           </note> of thoſe that ſhall be departed before the day of the reſurrection, which be calleth ſleeping. But he ſpeaks yet more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificently in the Epiſtle which hee wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the Philippians, where he calles the departure of ſoules from bodies,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.</note> diſlod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. Which agreeth well with the ſaying of Ieſus Chriſt, who being deſirous to aduertiſe his Diſciples of his approaching death, ſaid vnto them, That the howre drewe neere,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Iohn.</hi> 13.</note> that hee was to paſſe from this world to goe to God the Father; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the corporall death a paſſage by the which we muſt paſſe out of this vale of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, for to enter into the fruition and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a Paradiſe that is to ſay, of a place of aſſured reſt, and full of delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The which the ancient Greekes haue alſo taught by the name which they haue giuen to death, calling it, <hi>Thanaton,</hi> which is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:150422:46"/>
as much to ſay according to the <hi>Tymologie</hi> which <hi>Temiſte</hi> hath giuen of it, that <hi>ano eis ton theon;</hi> in French is, now vp to God, and <hi>Telutin eion ei teletin,</hi> conſecration: as if he would ſay that death is like vnto a ſolemne ceremonie, by the which the faithfull are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together conſecrated and dedicated to God, for afterwards to apply themſelues to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exerciſe then to ſing the praiſes of God and to ſanctifie his holy name. And for that regard Ieſus Chriſt did alſo call it Baptiſme,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.</note> becauſe that by death we paſſe as by a port, and thorow a water to arriue in a place of reſt and pleaſure whither we pretend. And if the bodie which the Greekes call <hi>Soma,</hi> to ſhew that it is a ſepulcher to the ſoule, which they call by a name comming very neere to the other, to wit, <hi>Sima,</hi> where it ſeemes that during this life it is as it were buried and interred; when it pleaſeth God to take it away, is it not as if he made it to come out of a tombe, and that he raiſed it. What occaſion then can men haue to flie from bodily death, and to abhorre it ſo; ſeeing that ſeparating the ſoule from the bodie, it puts the ſoule out of priſon, and ſends it in libertie to heauen, there to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the boſome of Ieſus Chriſt, and to enioy with him and all the happie ſpirits
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:150422:46"/>
the euerlaſting conſolations which are there promiſed and reſerued for the elect. And the bodie on the other ſide in the earth, as in a bed, there for to ſleepe and reſt at his eaſe, without that his ſlumber be any more interrupted or troubled, neither by trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome dreames, nor by cares and ſolicitudes, nor by feares, nor by alarmes and violent noyſes, nor by any other occaſion whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and that vntill the day of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in the which it ſhall be awaked by the ſound of Gods trumpet, &amp; reunitted to the ſoule, hauing loſt his mortalitie, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</note> diſhonour and weakeneſſe in the earth, and bing clothed againe with glory, force, immortalitie and incorruption. Wherin we may ſee that it is without reaſon that men are ſo greatly affraid of the bodily death; the which for a time ſeparates the body from the ſoule to the great profit of the one and the other; For the bodie is by that meanes out of all danger, not onely of ſinne and of miſeries which it draweth along with it, but alſo of all temptation, lying &amp; reſting in the earth in aſſured hope of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and euerlaſting life.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:150422:56"/>
hope to receiue in heauen, when that our ſoules ſeparated from our bodies, being then mounted, ſhall heare that ſweet muſicke and harmony of Angels and other happy Spirits, ſinging with one accord the praiſes of God, with ſuch a melodious ſound, that the contentment and ioy which they ſhall conceiue thereby, ſhall make them in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to forget not only all diſpleaſure, but alſo all other pleaſure? Like as a Tubbe of water is no more ſeene ſo ſoone as it is caſt into the Sea, nor the brightneſſe of the Starres when the Sunne beginnes to ſhine, and to caſt his beames vpon the earth. Moreouer, when we die in the faith of our Lord, we are euen at the ſame inſtant moſt happy, that is to ſay, that then we haue no more deſires, but ſuch as are holy, and which at the ſelfe ſame houre of our death are fully glutted and ſatisfied; Which is not a ſmall felicity, that wee hauing no more fleſh to contrary the ſpirit, nor rebellious appetites to reaſon, nor law in our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers diſagreeing to the law of God; but that all tumults and troubles ceaſing in our hearts, we may haue a ſoule altogither ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, calme, peaceable, liuing wholly to God, and which may be ſo faſtened and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited vnto him, that neither by temptations

nor any occaſion it can be diſtracted neither from his loue and ſeruice, nor from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of his face.

proportion, which ought to bee in the members thereof, for the good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of euery one in particular, and of all the body in generall; which is the goodlieſt thing and moſt agreeable that is to be ſeene, if it might bee ſeene amongſt men. It is alſo a very pleaſant thing to heare a good lute well tuned, when it is touched by a skilfull player; But yet there is nothing more pleaſant, then a ſoule well tuned in all her faculties, when the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thinkes no more vpon any thing but God, and our will loueth, deſireth nor aſpires after any thing but him, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally our memory hath no other remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance but of him, as it happeneth vnto it, when hauing forſaken the body, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in Paradiſe; For then it is all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with God,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</note> who is in her all things afterwards (as ſaith the Apoſtle) that is to ſay, all her thoughts, all her loue and deſires, all her delights, all her remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance: Briefe, all her good, her part, her wiſhing and contentment is in God. Seeing then that by death wee attayne to a good, which wee cannot finde in this world, in what ſtate ſoeuer wee are, and what commodities ſoeuer wee haue; for there is no King, nor Prince, nor Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

nor Merchant, nor Aduocate, who liuing in this world, doth not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten complayne, and who hath not great occaſions to complayne, many things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to all of them contrary to their liking, deſire, and hope: are not wee then much beholding to death, when in a moment it maketh vs to enioy the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne good, which conſiſteth in the perfect reſt of our mindes, and in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of all our deſires; the which indeede vaine men in vaine ſeeke for in the tranſitory thinges of this world? There is yet an other point which ought to make vs to embrace death willingly when our houre is come, which is, that it putteth vs in poſſeſſion of all the good thinges which Ieſus Chriſt hath purchaſed for vs. For whiles we liue in this world we are ſaued (as ſaith <hi>S. Paul</hi>) but by hope on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; But when by death wee depart out of it, then we ſhall enioy the euerlaſting life, and that ſo great good, which the eye, the eare, the vnderſtanding, and the heart of man, cannot conceiue nor apprehend the greatneſſe of it. It was a great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the children of Iſrael when after ſo long and hard a bondage in the which they had bin detained in Aegypt, after ſo many

But men are ſo farre from doing that, that of the ſeauen dayes in the weeke there is neuer a one wherein GOD is ſo much propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and blaſphemed, as hee is on thoſe dayes; which now a dayes ſeemes to bee appointed to giue paſtime to the Diuell, to our fleſh, for dancing, feaſting, and all other merry paſtimes, which the one and the other deſire. Who is hee then that can with reaſon bee ſorry for ſuch pleaſures when they leaue them? the which bring nothing elſe but ſhame and diſhonour, ſpoile and loſſe of goods, infinite diſeaſes to body and ſoule, a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and dulneſſe; ruines and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:150422:74"/>
of Countries, Kingdomes, and houſes, a contempt of vertue and of all honeſty, a hatred of all true religion and of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whom theſe ſwine flie from, and haue in ſuch horror, that they would gladly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heare talke of him; Which moreouer doe not only effeminate vs, but make vs in the end like vnto beaſts, and they ſtay not long to bring vs to death, when wee continue in them. Let vs then looke that by their flatteries and faire countenance, they doe not ſeduce vs. Their apparant beauty which appeares outward, is alluring, and deceiues thoſe that doe not beware of the poyſon that is hidden vnderneath. Like vnto the Bird and the Fiſh that are taken with the hooke,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> being drawen thereunto and deceiued by the baite that couers it. Let vs then behold them behind and not before, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did wiſely admoniſh; for pleaſures before ſeeme faire like vnto <hi>Syrenes;</hi> but if men looke vpon them behinde, they draw after them a long Serpents taile ſo vgly, that the ſight of it only is fearefull. Ha, who were able to recount the deluge of euils and miſeries that haue befallen vs by that little pleaſure which our firſt Parents had in eating the fruit that was forbidden them? Which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:150422:74"/>
was cauſe that God, who is ſo patient and ſo ſtow to wrath, did ſend that great deluge of waters vpon the earth, by the which he blotted out and raced euery liuing ſoule from off the face of the earth, reſeruing none aliue but onely <hi>Noah</hi> and his wife, and the liuing creatures which he gathered into the Arke with him. The occaſion of ſo horrible and fearefull a iudgement of God, was it not the filthy whordomes that reigned in thoſe dayes amongſt men, who tooke indifferently all the women and maids they pleaſed, without hauing any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the order and honeſty which GOD had commanded in inſtituting marriage at the beginning of the world? What was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the cauſe of the totall ſubuerſion and ruine of Sodome and the Townes round about, but their infamous adulteries, and the filthy pleaſures that they tooke in their banquets and gluttony? Wherefore alſo did God anger himſelfe ſo ſharpely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his people in the deſerts, where at one time hee ſlew three and twenty thouſand, and at an other a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; was it not by reaſon of the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes which they committed with the Madianitides? And the quailes which they had demaunded to ſatisfie their gluttony,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:150422:75"/>
whereof GOD would perpetuate, the memory, commaunding that the place; where they had receiued ſo great a wound, ſhould bee afterwards called the Sepulcres; of concupiſcence? What did happen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in <hi>Hemors</hi> houſe and Towne, by reaſon of the whoredome which his ſonne <hi>Sichem</hi> had committed with <hi>Dina, Iacobs</hi> onely Daughter? And in <hi>Dauids</hi> for hauing abuſed the wife of his ſeruant <hi>Vriah?</hi> And <hi>Salomons</hi> his ſonne who was ſo wiſe, and had receiued of GOD ſo many honours and fauours, and ſo much glory, richeſſe, and power, and beſides all that ſo many faire and excellent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of GOD, that hee might iuſtly call himſelfe, of all the Kings and Princes of the earth the Pearle? And neuertheleſſe the delights and pleaſures of the world, could mannage him ſo well, that they tooke away his good vnderſtanding, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in his old age when hee ſhould haue had moſt prudence, and his iudgement moſt ſetled and ſtayed. And they made him not onely to forget GOD, and the obligation which hee had towards him; But alſo to ſacrifice vnto Idols, like a man out of his wits, and that to ſatisfie to the Women and ſtrange Concubines
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:150422:75"/>
wherewith hee had acquainted himſelfe, againſt the expreſſe commaundement of GOD; whereupon afterward followed many euils vnto his houſe, and to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. <hi>Achabs</hi> houſe was it not ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and deſtroyed euen to the roote, by reaſon of the whoredomes as well corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall as ſpirituall that reigned therein? What was the cauſe of ſo many piteous tragedies, that haue beene written of the ruines, miſeries and deſolations hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the houſe of <hi>Priam,</hi> a King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in riches, greatneſſe, and glory, amongſt all the greateſt and mightieſt Princes of Aſia; was it not the fooliſh loue betweene <hi>Helen</hi> and <hi>Paris?</hi> The occaſion likewiſe of thoſe which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Court of great <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> after hee was returned from Troy with victory, and loaden with glory and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was it not the impudency of his wife <hi>Clitemnestra,</hi> and of <hi>Aegiſtus,</hi> her adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer? The ſpoiles which were made in Ionia in the time of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the great calamities and miſeries that fell ouer all the Countrey, which was the faireſt and moſt fruitfull that was in all Aſia, did they not alſo proceede of this occaſion, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> reciteth?

                        <p>The which then to do, we muſt firſt ſhew them, that all ſickneſſe commeth from God, and he ſendeth it, ſometimes to chaſtiſe and to bridle vs, ſometimes to proue and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our vertue; giuing vs by that meanes matter and argument to ſhew the affiance and truſt that we haue in him, to require his mercie by prayers, and ſighings, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confeſſe our faults and offences with griefe &amp; diſpleaſure; and to bring the ſicke to this point, to cauſe him to make a true and humble confeſſion of his ſinne.</p>

                           <pb n="146" facs="tcp:150422:81"/>Secondly we muſt propound vnto him, that it is the ſpring and principall cauſe of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes as well corporall as ſpirituall, and for to heale them, they muſt take away the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which ingendred them; that is to ſay, our ſinnes, whereof we cannot be otherwiſe deliuered, but by the remiſſion and pardon that God giueth vs of them by his grace; prouided (as ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn</hi>) that we confeſſe them vnto him,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.</note> and be aſſured that Ieſus Chriſt is our aduocate and mediator to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, by the means of his iuſtice wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he couereth and blots them out, in ſuch ſort that they come not in iudgement.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe that the loue which we beare naturally doth blind vs, and is cauſe that we neuer thinke our ſelues ſo vicious, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect as we are, we muſt (to take away this vaile from before the eyes of the ſicke) lay before him the law of God, as a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king glaſſe, wherein hee may behold his whole life, and to giue him to vnderſtand how by that, not onely our actions, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo our whole nature is condemned.</p>
                        <p>And for proofe and confirmation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of alledge generally vnto him, that we are all conceiued in ſinne, and borne the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, that we are but fleſh and all vanity, that we are ſold vnder ſinne, that in

vs there is no goodneſſe, that euen all our iuſtice is but olde ragges; and for conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that we are nothing at all, but duſt and putrifaction.

                        <p>That he hath not alwaies put his whole truſt in him.</p>
                        <p>That he hath often doubted of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and hath miſtruſted his helpe.</p>

                        <p>That hee hath not waited for all his proſperity and aduancement from his onely fauour and bleſſing.</p>
                        <p>That he hath not alwaies called vpon him in his affairs, with aſſurance &amp; certaine hope

to be vnderſtood, and to obtaine.</p>
                        <p>That he hath not alwaies feared and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced him, as did appertaine to his high and ſoueraigne Maieſtie.</p>
                        <p>That hee hath not alwaies giuen him thankes, and bleſſed his name for all things, and at all times, as well in aduerſitie as in proſperitie.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Afterwards, that thinking vpon God, he hath preſented him vnto himſelfe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vnder a humane and corporall figure.</p>
                        <p>That he hath not apprehended him like vnto a Spirit being immenſe, infinite, inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, immortall, impaſſible, vnchangeable, ſoueraigne in might, goodneſſe, mercy, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and verity, like vnto a protector of all vertue and perfection, and a ſpring of all life and light, fountaine of all fulneſſe and good, the ſcope of beatitude and felicity, beginning and end of all things, who is, and by his onely word cauſeth all creatures to ſubſiſt.</p>

                        <p n="3">3 That ſpeaking of God, it hath not bene with ſuch reſpect and reuerence of his Maieſtie as did appertaine; that he hath not ſtudied to ſanctifie, celebrate and glorifie his name as he ought.</p>

                        <p>That he hath not heard, reade and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the word of God, with ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, feare and zeale as was required, to doe honour vnto the Lord who ſpake, and in whoſe name it was denounced vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
                        <p>That he hath not alwaies ſpoken of the workes of God, nor in them acknowledged the greatneſſe of his power, wiſedome, and goodneſſe, with ſuch praiſe, admiration, and aſtoniſhment as they deſerue by their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude and magnificence.</p>
                        <p>That being at the Lords table at all times when the communion hath bene celebrated in the Church, it hath not bene with ſuch humility and deuotion, nor ſuch conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the myſtery there ſet before him, nor

ſuch eleuation of his heart vpwards, where Ieſus Chriſt is ſet at the right hand of God his father, as he ought to haue done.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 That in the daies appointed to abſtaine and reſt from prophane and bodily worke, to the end wholy to be applied to the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification onely of the name of God, hee hath not altogether giuen himſelfe to the meditation and exerciſes of ſpiritual things, thinking vpon, nor ſeeking after nothing, but onely thoſe that are aboue.</p>
                        <p>That he hath often bene more curious of his temporall affaires, then to ſeeke the kingdome of God and his iuſtice, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by that meanes this tranſitorie and corruptible life, before the happy and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and the care of his bodie before that which he ſhould haue had of his ſoule: and the ſeruice of the world, and of his fleſh before the ſeruice of God, which hee ought to haue honoured aboue all things.</p>
                        <p>That for ſmall and light occaſions he hath diſpenced with himſelfe not being at the place of conuocations and Eccleſiaſticall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, there to make a publike confeſſion and proteſtation of his faith, to ſhew his deuotion, and the feare that he hath of God, to edifie the company by his example,

and to publiſh to euery one without ſhame, without feare, and without any diſſimulation and hypocriſie, the religion that hee meanes to follow and hold, and in the which hee is reſolued to liue and die.</p>
                        <p>That hee hath not employed himſelfe to inſtruct and catechiſe his wife, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, his ſeruants, and all his familie, as he is bound, calling them to morning and euening prayer, exhorting them to reade and meditate the word of God, and to ſing Pſalmes, Hymnes, and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles to his praiſe, and to conferre amongſt them of all holy things, and not to holde any ſpeech but that onely that may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance and make them them to grow more and more in the knowledge and feare of God.</p>
                        <p>That after the ſpirituall exerciſes to the which men ought principally to giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the daies of reſt, as to heare the exhortations with feare and reuerence, and in all humilitie to aſſiſt at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke confeſſions, prayers, and thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuings that are made and giuen to God in the whole aſſembly, hee hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued himſelfe the reſt of the day to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite the priſoners, to comfort the ſicke,

                        <p>After hauing thus briefly diſcourſed to the ſicke the faultes which he may haue committed againſt the commandements of the firſt Table, then muſt you paſſe from thence to the ſecond, and giue him to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand:</p>

                        <p>That he hath not alwaies ſo well prayed to God for their health and proſperity, and to direct them with his holy Spirit in their counſels, and to giue them the grace to gouerne themſelues by his word in all their actions, and generally to bleſſe and direct them in all their waies, as he was bound thereunto by the expreſſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God.</p>
                        <p>That he hath not had ſuch an opinion and

                        <p>That he hath not often ſpoken of them nor of their faſhions and demeanures in ſuch honour as might be required. And if in his preſence any would blaſe or prate of them, that he hath not oppoſed himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and hath not forbidden them as he ought.</p>

                        <p>That hee hath deſired and ſought the meanes to be reuenged of his enimies, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no reckoning of the defence which God maketh againſt it, reſeruing the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſute and vengeance to himſelfe of all the wrong done to his children and ſeruants.</p>

                           <pb n="154" facs="tcp:150422:85"/>That hee hath not beene pittifull to the poore, nor done his duty in adminiſtring of his goods vnto them, to nouriſh and clothe them, lodge and fit them with things neceſſary to the comforting and entertayning of their poore life, and to the eaſing of ſo many miſeries and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, wherewith they are inuironed on euery ſide.</p>
                        <p>That hee hath not viſited his poore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren being ſicke, nor afforded them bodily and ſpirituall comfort.</p>
                        <p>That hee hath not oppoſed himſelfe againſt the wicked and malicious men, that did oppreſſe them, and hath not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his power and his meanes to defend them, from the violence and outrage that is done vnto them.</p>
                        <p>That hee hath not reioyced at the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of his neighbours; but hath beene iealous and enuious of their felicity, when hee hath ſeene that God did bleſſe them, and did aduaunce them to ſome higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree then hee.</p>

ought for this regard to keepe it from all filthineſſe and pollution.</p>
                        <p>That hee hath not turned his eyes from falſe beholdings ſo carefully as hee ought, but in ſteede of retaining and keeping them in, hath ſuffered them to ſtray and runne after all their concupiſcences.</p>
                        <p>That hee hath not ſubdued his fleſh vnto ſuch ſeruitude as hee ought, to make it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect or obedient to the ſpirit in all points.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>LATO ſaid, that the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie wherein man (li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in this world) ſhould principally exerciſe himſelf, is the meditation of death; that is to ſay, of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, fraile, diſeaſed, and mortall; of the diuers accidents of this humane life, and of her houre ſo vncertaine and vnknowne; to the end that conſidering theſe things, hee might withdraw his affection and truſt from this world, that he might deſpiſe it, and all temporall things, wherein he ſees and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couers ſo much inconſtancy, and ſuch ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and frequent mutations or changes: and that by ſuch a deſpiſing of vncertaine &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall things, he ſhould ſtir vp himſelfe vnto
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:150422:109"/>
a contemplation of thoſe that are diuine, and heauenly; And forſaking that which is heere periſhing and tranſitorie (vnto worldly men) hee ſhould chuſe his part in heauen, and ſhould ſtay himſelfe at that which is permanent and eternall. For the like reaſon, <hi>Philip</hi> the father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, a man of good vnderſtanding, and of very great conſideration, to the end that in the middeſt of his great proſperity, he ſhould not forget himſelfe in his dutie, gaue order that one of his Gentlemen ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euery day at his awaking come and ſpeake theſe words vnto him; King, haue in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance that thou art a mortall man.</p>
                        <p>Ieſus Chriſt alſo our Sauiour and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, tending to the ſame end, doth exhort vs to watch, &amp; to lay vp treaſures in heauen, and not on earth, where all things are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine and changeable. Wee ſee by that, that during our life, we cannot doe better then to thinke vpon death, and our bodie being vpon the earth, to accuſtome our ſelues to haue alwaies our ſpirit and heart in heauen. Now becauſe that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of death is a fearefull thing to many, I haue bethought my ſelfe, to paſſe away my griefes, and to recreate my ſelfe from my other ſtudies, and alſo to giue you a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:150422:109"/>
teſtimony of the Obligation which I thinke I haue towards you, as well for the good which you haue done vnto mee, as for the friendſhip which you beare me, to write vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and to preſent this ſmall Treatiſe, wherein I haue briefely touched certaine points, wherewith the faithfull may arme themſelues againſt death: which hee ought to doe in time, and prepare himſelfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it with aſſurance, at ſuch time as it ſhal pleaſe God to ſend it; for that which doth aſtoniſh many, is that the comming thereof is ſuddaine vnto them, and that they are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed vnlooked for. We ſee by experience, in a frontier towne, that when it is well vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualled, and prouided of all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, for to withſtand a long ſiege, thoſe within are a great deale the more aſſured and bold; whereas if it were vnprouided, they would ſtand amazed and tremble with feare, if they ſhould chance to ſee the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching of the ſiege. It is eaſie to iudge by that, of what importance it is to haue preuented a danger, and to bee prepared for it.</p>
                        <p>Then to prouide and arme the faithfull man againſt death, wee muſt note that there are two ſorts of it: the one is temporall of the body, which Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ought to deſire;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:150422:110"/>
the other is eternall, of bodie and ſoule which they ought not to feare, perfeuering in the faith of our Lord.</p>
                        <p>That it is ſo, all feare preſuppoſeth euill and danger; we doe not feare that which is good, but long after, deſire and purſue it, and when it offers it ſelfe, we receiue it ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: But an euill, we apprehend and feare, we flie from it, and when it happens vnto vs, we ſorrow, and do complaine. If then it doth appeare by good and euident proofes, that the faithfull man is not in danger of this ſecond death, may we not then conclude, that if we feare it, it is fooliſh and without occaſion? And ſurely if we had iudgement, and neuer ſo little faith, it were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent preſently to take away the feare of it from vs.</p>
                        <p>For firſt, the proper nature of faith is to animate and quicken our heart, ſo ſoone as it is receiued in vs. The iuſt, ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſhall liue by faith. Now euen ſo as the bodie, whiles the ſoule is in it, liueth, and dieth not, vntill ſuch time as it be ſeparated from it; no more doth the faithfull man, perſeuering in the faith which hath bene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired and put into his heart by the grace of God. Although (ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi>) I ſhould walke in the middeſt of the ſhadow of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:150422:110"/>
death, I will not feare; for thou art with mee O Lord. What was the cauſe of this aſſurance? was it not faith? wherewith we ought no more to feare death, then wee doe ſickneſſe when we are in perfect health, well diſpoſed, and in good liking; or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, when we haue plenty and abundance of all good things.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, by faith we haue remiſſion, and an abolition of all the faults which we haue done; why doe wee then feare death? There is no death where there is no ſinne; by ſinne death came into the world, ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul:</hi> and elſe where; The reward of ſinne is death; ſinne cauſeth God to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie with vs, and that in his anger he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes vs to death. Now all ſeedes doth bring forth, euery one according to their ſort and qualitie. The wheat bringeth forth wheat, and the Rie, Rie, and we muſt not hope for any fruit, if there be not ſeede be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand.</p>
                        <p>That being true, and witneſſed in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand places of the Scripture, that vnto a Chriſtian all his ſinnes and debts are quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him by the grace and mercy of God, that they are forgotten, that they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, that they are not imputed, and that they are remitted and pardoned, that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:150422:111"/>
they are caſt as farre from vs, as the Eaſt from the Weſt; Prouided that there be no more ſeede thereof, we neede not looke for any fruite: That is to ſay, if there be no more ſinne, there is no more anger of God, nor of death, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent that alſo there ought to be no more feare.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, by faith: wee haue the word, and the promiſes of God, whereupon it is grounded: Among others this; Who ſo beleeueth ſhall not die, but is paſſed from death to life. Now this promiſe can no more faile, then he that gaue it vs. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. And all that God ſaith, is as ſure and permanent, as heauen, or earth; For this cauſe when wee looke into them, wee ought in them to conſider the vertue and power of this word, by the which they were once created, and euer ſince pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued and maintained in that eſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in now we ſee them, and to inferre thereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon: that being of the ſame power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in all other things, nothing is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nor vncertaine of all that which God doth ſay and promiſe vnto vs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, Receiuing his holy word by faith in our hearts, and the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which hee hath made vs, to giue vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:150422:111"/>
life, wee ought to aſſure our ſelues of it, and take away all feare and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of death. What was the cauſe of the ruine of vs and our forefathers? was it not becauſe they did decline from the word of God to follow their owne fancies and the counſell of Satan? If then to the contrarie wee will cleaue to it, without leaning any iot neither to the right hand nor to the left, wee ſhall liue by it, and in it. Hearken vnto mee, ſaith God (ſpeaking by <hi>Eſay</hi>) and your ſoule ſhall liue. And <hi>Zacharie</hi> in his Canticle; Hee hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs a ſcience of ſaluation. And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking to IESVS CHRIST, Thy wordes are wordes of eternall life. If God, the Prophets and Apoſtles, doe aſſure vs that the word of God, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by a true faith in our heartes, doth there quicken, keeping and retaining it, what occaſion haue wee then to feare death?</p>
                        <p>Moreouer by faith wee dwell in IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST, and haue him dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in vs, who hauing life in himſelfe as his father, doth quicken vs, and all thoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom he doth communicate himſelfe, Wherefore then being his members, fleſh
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:150422:112"/>
of his fleſh, and bone of his bones; briefe, being one with him ſhall wee feare death? Hath not hee power ouer it, and not onely for himſelfe, but alſo for vs? He, ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who hath once ouercome death for vs, will alwaies ouercome it in vs. Hath not hee beate downe, diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, chaſed and ſpoyled Satan, the Prince and Lord of death? hath not hee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed the law? and by this perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which hee hath borne to God his Father, appeaſed his anger, ſatisfied his will, and aboliſhed the malediction of the law, which is nothing elſe but death? Did not hee die to make it die? when hee roſe againe, hath not he bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and diſſipated all the torments, pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked downe the gates of Hell, and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed ouer her and all her power? Say not henceforth ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſhall go vp into heauen, or who ſhall deſcend into the depthes, for to bring life vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs? for IESVS CHRIST is dead, and riſen againe from the dead, for to deliuer vs from death; and riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to reſtore vs to life; Hee is our Paſtor; And for this reaſon wee ought not to feare, that any creature ſhould ſnatch vs by violence out of his handes,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:150422:112"/>
or can hinder him from giuing vs eternall life. He is our Aduocate, we ought not then to feare to be ouerthrowne in iudgement; nor that by ſentence we ſhould be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death: He is our Mediator, we neede not to feare the wrath of God: Hee is our light, we neede not to feare the darkeneſſe: He is our ſhadow and our cloude, we ought not then to feare the heate of the fire eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, no more then did the children of Iſrael the heate of the Sunne in the Wilderneſſe, being hidden vnder the pillar. Let vs then for theſe reaſons forſake and caſt behinde vs all feare of death; the which hauing had no power nor aduantage ouer the head, ſhall haue no power ouer his members.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Item,</hi> By faith we haue with Ieſus Chriſt God his Father, and are allied &amp; ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him, as he ſaith by his Prophet, I will marry thee if thou wilt promiſe me thy faith: and Ieſus Chriſt in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn;</hi> Hee that loueth me will keepe my worde, and I and my Father will come and dwell in him: for this reaſon we are alſo called his Temples, becauſe we are conſecrated and dedicated vnto him by his holy ſpirite, that he ſhould dwell in vs. Now ſeeing God is with vs, we haue the originall, the fountaine, the cauſe, the beginning and the author of life; we
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:150422:113"/>
haue the great <hi>Iehouah;</hi> of whom all things depend, by whom all things are and moue: in whom the Angels, Arch-angels, Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, the heauens and all the elements con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; we haue him that is the true <hi>Zeus,</hi> from whom al creatures, viſible and inuiſible take their life and their being, by the participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they haue with him: We haue him who is the true <hi>Promitefz,</hi> moſt perfect and ſoueraigne worke-man of all things, who by his breath doth quicken and make them to liue: We haue <hi>ton Theon,</hi> that is to ſay, he who diſcourſing all things, by his power infinite doth preſerue them: Wee haue, to make ſhort <hi>AEL,</hi> that is to ſay, he who onely can ſatisfie, and by his preſence cauſe that of life &amp; of all other good things we ſhall haue, and thinke we haue enough: Shall we then feare death in ſuch company? If as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, God is the ſoule of our ſoule, we cannot die but by being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from him; the which <hi>Dauid</hi> doth confirme in one of his Pſalmes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Thoſe ſhall periſh O Lord, who doe depart and go from thee; which being conſidered, let vs ſtriue onely to keepe him with vs by faith and obedience, and beſides, let vs take away all the feare which we may haue of death.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="209" facs="tcp:150422:113"/>Againe, by faith wee haue the ſpirite of God: you are not carnall, ſayth S. <hi>Paul,</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Romanes, but are ſpirituall; for who hath not the ſpirit of God are none of his. And elſe-where ſpeaking to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians; Haue you not the ſpirit of God by faith? Now this ſpirit is the ſpirit of life; if God withdrawes it from his creatures they die, they periſh, and come ſuddenly to nought: to the contrary, when he pleaſeth to ſend and powre it vpon them, he raiſeth and reſtoreth them in an inſtant; euen as we ſee a Hen brooding of her egges, by a ſecret vertue doth diſcloſe and bring them to life, albeit that before they were without ſoule or feeling. Euen ſo doth the ſpirit of God, al creatures by his diuine power: He giueth teſtimony and doth aſſure vs in our hearts that we are the children of God, to the end that from him as from our father, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and aſſured hope wee ſhould waite and looke for life: He is as a pledge vnto vs for feare left wee ſhould doubt. Hauing ſuch earneſt of life, hauing teſtimony from him, who being the ſpirit of truth cannot lie nor abuſe, hauing him himſelfe who is the preſeruer of all creatures; ſhall we feare death? It is as much as who ſhould feare the darkeneſſe at none-day,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:150422:114"/>
the ſpirite of him who hath raiſed againe Ieſus Chriſt, and who hath vp-held him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhould not be ouercome of death, being in vs will quicken vs alſo, ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and wil preſerue vs from it; let vs then put away all feare of it.</p>
                        <p>Faith alſo cauſeth that God doth adopt and repute vs for his children: you are all children of God by faith, ſaith S. <hi>Paul:</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> he hath giuen power to al thoſe that ſhall receiue him, and beleeue in his name, to be made the children of God; then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing children, we are the heires &amp; co-heires with Ieſus Chriſt; and we are by the meanes of this adoption certaine once to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, vnto the reſt, and vnto the glory wherein we ſhall reigne eternally with his Father. Moreouer, being children of God, we are of his houſhold, and it is not in his houſe where death dwelleth, it is in hell in the diuels houſe; in heauen and the place where God abides, there is an vnſpeakeable light, ſo great a beatitude and happineſſe, that in the contemplation thereof, <hi>Dauid</hi> crying out, ſaid, O that they are happy that doe inhabite and dwell in thy houſe! And elſe-where; In this conſiſts all my good, Lord that I may be neere vnto thee. Again, being children we are at liberty, free from
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:150422:114"/>
ſinne, free from death, free from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and rigor of the law, freed from the ſeruice and force of the diuell: what do we feare being then children of God, and conſequently brothers of Ieſus Chriſt? Is it poſſible that he can euer denie or abandon his fleſh and blood, or ſuffer them to die, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing power to ſaue them? Concluſion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the children of God our Father, hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs with a loue vnfained and fatherly. And if, as ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> during the time that we were his enemies, hee had ſuch a care o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs, that not ſparing his onely begotten Sonne, he hath deliuered him ouer to death to preſerue vs from it, and to reconcile vs vnto himſelfe, now that wee are his friends and in his fauour, will he not ſaue vs? Who is that man, who conſidering theſe reaſons, will not preſently aſſure himſelfe, and doe away all feare which he had of death? That which alſo ought to aſſure vs againſt death, &amp; take away all feare which we haue of her, and the diſhonour of the tribulation, of the horror and anguiſh prepared for the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and damned, is our calling: that God of his grace hath vouchſafed to withdraw vs out of the darkeneſſe wherein we were, and to illumine vs by his holy ſpirite, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs by his holy word, wherein we ought
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:150422:115"/>
to truſt, and wherein lieth our ſaluation; and ſo what we ought to doe to pleaſe and obey him, to the end that walking in his law and ſeruing him in all iuſtice and holineſſe, we might after we haue a little ſuffered in this world, be faithfully glorified with him in the end: for that which God beginneth he will accompliſh; and when he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to call any one to him and to ſaue him, hee neuer changeth his counſell, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth repent himſelfe of the good that he will doe vnto him. He is vnchangeable, and ſo ſtedfaſt in his purpoſe and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that that which he once willes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daines, he doth execute without being tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from it. If then we feele in our ſelues that God hath giuen vs the grace to heare, to beleeue, and to loue his word, and to flye from and reiect all that which is contrary to it, and to haue an affection to obſerue that which he commandeth vs, and a diſlike, if haply by infirmity or otherwiſe, we chance to commit any thing againſt his law: let vs not doubt but we are regenerate, elected, and predeſtinated to eternall life, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently out of danger of death. Let vs then take away all feare, and let vs ſay with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> What ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue and charity of God? what ſhall make vs to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:150422:115"/>
thinke, that he hath not a will to ſaue vs? It ſhall not bee paine, affliction, hunger, perſecution, nor any aduerſity, nor death, nor any creature whatſoeuer ſhall make vs to doubt that hee doth not loue vs, in the fauour of Ieſus Chriſt; and that hauing choſen; called and iuſtified vs in him, but that finally he will alſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vs by him.</p>
                        <p>The Sacraments which IESVS CHRIST hath left vs for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our faith ought likewiſe to aſſure and ſtrengthen vs againſt the feare of death.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Baptiſme by the which wee are buried and die with Chriſt, that wee may riſe againe with him; in the which wee are waſhed from all our ſinnes, and clothed with his innocency, to the end that preſenting our ſelues to the Father, ſo adorned and couered with the robe of our elder brother, we may receiue his holy bleſſing, and be ſaued from the great deluge, wherein all the infidels periſh, as <hi>Noe</hi> was in his time by the Arke. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing then the promiſes of God, as we haue ſaid before, and ouer and aboue his ſigne, by the which he is bound to render that life to vs, which we haue loſt by our ſin; wherfore
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:150422:116"/>
doe we feare death, doe we thinke that he wil reuoke or that he wil denie and diſauow his ſigne?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the Lords Supper, where wee take the bread and the wine, for to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into the Communion and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body and blood of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and by conſequent into the fruits of them: that is, to haue part in his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in his iuſtice, in his ſatisfaction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, in the Teſtament and new alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and generally in all the promiſes of God, the which by his death haue beene ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. It remaineth now to conclude our purpoſe, and to inferre vpon the precedent things, that if we feare death, it is for want of conſidering them, or if wee doe conſider them, it is for want of beleeuing them; for there is no man ſo timorous, being firmely perſwaded of that which is ſpoken, but will take away all feare of death, and will ſay with <hi>Dauid;</hi> I ſhall not die but alwaies liue, to declare perpetually the workes of the Lord, and praiſe him. And who will not ſcorne at it with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and inſult vpon it, ſaying, O death where is thy victory? where is thy ſting? where is thy ſtrength? where is the terrour and feare which men had of thee? Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour perceiuing
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:150422:116"/>
the time of his death draw neare, ſaid, that in ſhort time hee ſhould paſſe from this world to goe to his Father, calling death a paſſage; which ſhould greatly comfort vs. We haue almoſt all this opinion rooted in vs, and it is that which doth ſo diſcourage vs, that it is a dangerous paſſage &amp; vneaſie. Now for to take it from vs, and to ſtirre vp our hearts, he would needes paſſe it before vs, and as it were ſound the depth, to the end that we ſeeing that he did not ſticke at it, ſhould take courage: as alſo we ſee before and after him, the Prophets, Apoſtles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and other holy perſonages haue done it; who hauing paſſed it without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of danger, and being eſcaped ſafe and well, doe now reioyce with God, that they are gotten to the land and to the port where they did aſpire. Shall we then be ſuch cowards, ſhall we be ſo faint-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and of ſuch render and effeminate cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as to feare to goe by a place ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and a way ſo great and beaten, that men go it, as ſaid ſome of the Auncients, blindfolded Likewiſe we ſee that not one alone of thoſe that truſted in God, calling vpon his ayde, that put themſelues to paſſe it, did euer miſcarry: when the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell did feare at the paſſage of the redde
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:150422:117"/>
Sea, <hi>Moyſes</hi> did ſhew vnto them, that if they would truſt in God, they ſhould ſee his glory and power; which they did ſee, paſſing ſafely through the middeſt of the danger, whereas their enemies did remaine: ſo ſhall all the faithfull through the ſtraights of death, prouided that they commend themſelues to God, and doe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet their truſt vpon him. They being in the deſarts, although they were bitten by the Serpents, yet were they preſerued from the danger in looking vpon him, that <hi>Moyſes</hi> had cauſed to be erected; although alſo that the curſed and enuious ſerpent hath tainted vs with his venome, yet ſhall we not die if by faith we looke vpon Ieſus Chriſt crucified. Let death come, let it take vs, let it binde vs, yet ſhall wee breake the bonds as eaſily as did <hi>Samſon</hi> thoſe of the Philiſtines his enemies; let it ſwallow and deuoure vs as the Whale did <hi>Ionas,</hi> yet ſhall it be faine to diſgorge and caſt vs vp againe, if in the middeſt of the depth wee doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member God and call vpon him. Let it bury vs as it once did Ieſus Chriſt, yet ſhall wee riſe againe as hee did, and it ſhall be impoſſible for this Tyrant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vs vnder his power. After hauing ſhewed how wee ſhould arme our ſelues
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:150422:117"/>
againſt the apprehenſions of eternall death, let vs alſo ſhew that we ought not only nor to feare the temporall, but alſo deſire it; and when it pleaſeth God to ſend it vnto vs, to thanke him for it, to reioyce at it, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, and to ſing for ioy; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be that we behold the miſery, the miſhappes and euils of this life, from which it doth deliuer vs; or elſe the ioy and contentment of eternall life, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it doth bring vs.</p>
                        <p>As for the pouerties, miſeries, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certitudes, fragilities, accidents and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilities of this life, not onely the Scripture, but alſo diuers wiſe and great Philoſophers doth ſhew them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: And there is one amongſt them, who declaring the originall of the Greeke phraſe ſignifying life, ſayeth <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Our bodies are ſubiect to colde, to heat, to hunger, to thirſt, to time, to age, and to ſo many diſeaſes, that there is no part but hath his particular infirmity: the feete are ſubiect vnto the goutes, the belly vnto

The Greekes doe call the body of man in their language, <hi>Soma</hi> and <hi>Demas,</hi> whereof the one is taken from a phraſe which ſignifieth to binde, and the other comes neere to that which ſignifieth Sepulchre, for to ſhew vnto vs in what eſtate and diſpoſition ſoeuer he be, he doth repreſent rather death vnto vs then life, and ſeruitude then liberty. As for the ſoule, it is firſt ſubiect to all the euils and diſeaſes of the body: for it is vnpoſſible if that be ill, but that for the coniunction &amp; amity which is betweene them, it muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and feele paine.

                           <pb n="221" facs="tcp:150422:119"/>Theſe examples do ſufficiently ſhew, that the life of Kings is not ſo happy, as ſome men ſometimes eſteeme them, more by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour then by reaſon; and they are ſo farre from being at quiet and without trouble, that by reaſon of the great care and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they haue; the auncient Greekes ſurnamed them <hi>anacas, dia tô anacôs échin,</hi> ſayth <hi>Plutarke,</hi> in expounding the words: which is as much according to his expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as who ſhould ſay, carefull.

But we are much abuſed; for it is more vncertaine then it is miſerable: for to ſhew vs the vncertainty of it, the Auncients called it a ſhaddow, and a dreame, which are the two things in the world, the moſt vaine and leaſt ſetled in our eſtate. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> being once demaunded what humane life was, ſpake neuer a word; for his cuſtome was to anſwere and inſtruct more by ſignes then by wordes; but went into a chamber, and came forth againe preſently: ſignifying, that the life of man is but an entring in, and going out. And IESVS CHRIST exhorting vs to watch, grounds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vpon nothing elſe but vpon the inconſtancie and vncertaintie of this life: Watch, ſaith hee, for you know not at what houre the Lorde will come. And who is that man in how

Thoſe in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria doubted of nothing, when in an inſtant they were deſtroyed by the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of the Tower of Syloe. In the time of the flood they did build, and made marriages and banquets, when ſuddenly contrary to the expectation and opinion of all the world, the raine fell in cleere weather, which raine did ouerflow the whole earth. The rich man, wherof mention is made in the twelfth of LVKE, though hee was very ſecure; who hauing ſo much wealth that hee knew not where or whord it, made acount to giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to pleaſure, and to liue after that time at his eaſe; when, while hee was ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon theſe termes, beholde the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icant of GOD comes and arreſts him to appeare the ſame day, to giue vp an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count vnto him, of all the precious things and goods which hee had left, and which hee had gathered with ſuch great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                        <p>But it is labour loſt to goe about to prooue a thing ſo manifeſt, and which we experiment and ſee daily: For in this world there is nothing more ordinary nor

more frequent then that which <hi>Ouid</hi> ſaith that the life of man, and all humane things are hanged, and doe hold but by a little threed.</p>
                        <p>Let vs behold then, ſeeing on the one ſide the great euils whereof it is full, and on the other ſide the inconſtancy of the good which it hath; if we haue great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to deſire of God, that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long it vnto vs; or to complaine or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelues at death, when it taketh it away from vs?

The end of all that we doe, and of that which we purpoſe, is it not our reſt? Why doe we gather goods with a thouſand troubles, and as many dangers? why doe wee ſtudie? why doe wee fight? why doe we labour? why doe we all other things? Is it not by that meanes to come to eaſe, and to a reſt, which we pretend and ſeeke as a ſoueraigne good? What is the principall reward which God doth promiſe to his people, and to all thoſe that ſerue him faithfully, is it not a perpetuall reſt, whereinto he himſelfe is entred ſince the creation of the world? When we do pray vnto him that his kingdome come, is it not
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:150422:123"/>
to the end that we ſhould be in peace and reſt? Finally, what doe wee hope for at his handes, is it not that? Then the reſt which God hath promiſed vs, which we demaund of him, which we wait for, briefe, which we doe purpoſe as the end and concluſion of al that we doe and vndertake, is giuen vs by no other meanes but by death. Some ſeeke for it in their goods, which they loue, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing there to finde it; others in ſtudy, others in voluptuouſneſſe and worldly pleaſures: but all that is but an abuſe. For it is found but in death, which we ought more to loue for this reaſon, then the world doth his pleaſure, the couetous man his treaſure, the ſcholler his bookes, or the ambitious his humours; by reaſon that in one houre it putteth into our hands, and giues vs the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of goods, which they cannot finde by great labour all their life time, in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid things. Afterwards, death cauſeth that by it we are content, ſatisfied and very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Happy are thoſe w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> depart in the faith of our Lord, ſaith S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> Then is this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes the ſoueraigne good whereunto we aſpire, and which we cannot finde in this world, where we are neuer content. If we haue goods we deſire knowledge, if we haue knowledge wee deſire honours, if we haue
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:150422:123"/>
honours we deſire health, if we haue health we deſire to be young; briefely, we alwaies want ſomething which we ſeeke after, and when we cannot get it, that is a cauſe of grudging and diſcontentment. Then ſhall we be fully ſatisfied, as ſaith <hi>Dauid,</hi> when by death we are come to the Kingdome of God, and his glory hath appeared vnto vs.</p>
                        <p>In it are all things; it is the ſoueraigne good which in it dooth comprehend all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: therefore when wee ſhall haue it, our appetite and deſire ſhall reſt in it; we ſhall reſt there without going any further, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out demaunding or ſeeking for any thing elſe. Then ſhall be accompliſhed that which IESSVS CHRIST hath promiſed to all his faithfull, who, beleeuing in him with an entire faith, and ſuch a one as God requires in his word, will raiſe vp in their hearts a ſpring of water of life, ſpringing to life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. We ſhall no more feare any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more in danger; we ſhall deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, hauing all in our poſſeſſion; we ſhall hope for nothing, for all promiſes ſhall bee accompliſhed; wee ſhall no more aske any thing, for we ſhall haue no more neede; God ſhall bee all in all. If wee will be rich, we ſhall then haue him that doth inrich all thoſe that call vppon
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:150422:124"/>
his holy name. If we will be wiſe, we ſhall haue the heauenly wiſedome; if we will be mightie, we ſhall haue the Almightie; if we deſire to be good, we ſhall haue the onely excellent good: if we will be faire, we ſhall haue the great Architect, and perfect work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of all things: If we will be healthfull and liue long, we ſhall haue the eternall.</p>
                        <p>All our ſenſes ſhall be rauiſhed with the greatneſſe of the pleaſures which they ſhall haue and feele. Our eyes, ſeeing the great, ſumptuous and magnificent Pallace of our God, ſeeing the perfect &amp; ſoueraign beauty of his bright ſhining face: ſeeing the Sun of iuſtice, the fountaine of water of life, the tree of life, the Paradice, that is to ſay, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant garden of our God, his faire and noble company of Angels, of Apoſtles, Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches, Martyrs, and of all the bleſſed ſpirits. And if the onely ſight of Ieſus Chriſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured in the mountaine, was of ſuch great power, that S. <hi>Peter,</hi> all other thinges forgotten, in an inſtant, was thereby tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported out of himſelfe, and deſired ſo to remaine perpetually; what may we thinke of the ioy and pleaſure that he receiues, who ſeeth IESVS CHRIST glorified, and with him his Father, his holy Spirit, and all the aboueſaid aſſembly? Eye hath not

Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that we ſhould go in ſuch durty and muddy waies, without being durtied? We ſee it in good Saints of old time, who could not gouerne themſelues ſo well, but the ſerpent who alwaies dogs vs at the heeles, hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them with his venome; but that they haue fallen in diuers faults, ſome in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity, others in Idolatry, others in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, others in exceſſe and drunkenneſſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in murthers: there is none of them but had his fall, yea ſometimes ſo great &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, that they had bene altogether bruiſed, if God had not vpheld them with his hand.

                        <p>An other reaſon why death is to bee wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for, is that it cauſeth vs to ſee our friend and Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, of whom we haue as yet ſeene but the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. The Prophets and Apoſtles haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him vnto vs ſo faire, of ſuch a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtature, ſo courteous, ſo vertuous, ſo loyall, ſo eloquent, ſo louely, ſo noble, ſo rich, ſo louing of vs, that for our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee did abandon his owne life, which ought more to moue vs then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing. Where is that maid, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heard of ſo many perfections to be in her friend, would not burne, and be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tranſported with deſire and affection to ſee him? If our King, or ſome Prince of renowne, comes into our countrey, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee him, becauſe of the report which we haue heard of his vertue and valour. If <hi>Hercules, Alexander</hi> the great, <hi>Caeſar Cato,</hi>
                           <pb n="245" facs="tcp:150422:131"/>
of whom we ſo much commend the ancient pictures, were now in this world, we would through curioſitie goe a hundred miles to ſee them; with what an affection then ſhould we aſpire to that day, in the which we ſhall face to face ſee and behold that ſo mightie Prince, who with an inuincible force hath broken the head of all our enemies; who like vnto a valiant <hi>Ioſua,</hi> in deſpite of them hath brought vs through the dangers, and conducted vs into the land which God had promiſed vs? What a pleaſure ſhall it be to vs to ſee him glorious, in order and in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant array, and round about him the goodly trophees of his great victories ſet vp? It is ſaid that when <hi>Alexander</hi> had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Darius</hi> King of the Perſians, entring into the place where he made his reſidence, He ſits downe in his throne, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently a Greeke Gentleman of his company began to weepe for ioy in ſpeaking theſe words. O happy day in the which we ſee our King victorious againſt the Barbarians, and their pride trodde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder foot. O that all Grecia had now the ſight &amp; the pleaſure of this ſpectacle. Think what ioy, it will be alſo to euery faithfull man, to ſee Ieſus Chriſt in his royal ſeat, holding vnder his feet all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies &amp; ours, but ſpecially the ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t whoſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:150422:132"/>
head is alreadie broken, and now hee doth nothing elſe but wagge his tayle, waiting his finall end, which ſhall bee at the day of iudgement. May Kings and Princes did with great affection deſire to ſee him when he was on earth accuſtomed like a ſeruant.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Simeon</hi> becauſe he ſaw him ſo, did ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, and was ſo ſatisfied, that he feared no more to die: ought not we more to deſire to ſee him in heauen in a kingly robe, with company, greatneſſe, maieſtie and pompe, and in the ſtate of a Lotd. The Queene of Saba, who being induced by the rumour which was ſpred ouer all the earth of the great Court of King <hi>Salamon,</hi> came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thither, from the fartheſt part of the South, to ſee him, and to heare his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; after ſhe had diligently conſidered his great and maruellous wiſedome, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the ſplendour, and ſtate of his houſe, ſtood all aſtonied, &amp; with great admiration ſaid; O how happie are the ſeruants of thy houſe, who may ſee thy face euery day, and heare thy diuine ſpeeches; let vs ſay alſo, O thrice and foure times happy are the faithfull, who dying goe directly to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to be hold the face of Ieſus Chriſt, who is much more then <hi>Salomon;</hi> For the onely
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:150422:132"/>
contemplation of it, makes man content in euery point, in taking from vs the memory and feeling of all other pleaſures, cauſeth that we cannot nor will not turne our eyes and thoughts from it. Now death doth not onely cauſe vs to ſee Ieſus Chriſt, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs with him to behold the Angels, the Patriarkes, the Prophets, the Apoſtles, the Martyrs, which haue beene ſingular in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and vertues. And if any man that hath a hart towards God, deſires to ſee the Church well ordered in this world, and preferreth it to all that can be giuen him, albeit the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of is neuer ſo great, but that there will be many things more to be deſired; with what vehemence and heate ſhould he wiſh to ſee it in heauen, without ſpot or wrinkle, ſhining like the Sunne, clothed in robes as white as Snowe, ſet forth in nuptiall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?</p>
                        <p>The laſt reaſon for the which wee ought to deſire death, is, that by it our ſpirite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parted from the body, which doth clog it, is more at liberty and more capable to looke into the myſteries of God. We liue all in this world with a natural deſire to know; therefore is it that for our contentment, we ſeeke alwayes to heare and ſee ſome nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; then is it not poſſible that here beneath
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:150422:133"/>
we ſhould come to any great knowledge, chiefely of the truth, as well becauſe that of it ſelfe it is obſcure and hard to know, as for the cares, perturbations, afflictions, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, &amp;c. wherewith our minde is intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and hindered, whiles it is in our bodies, which are vnto it as duſt in a mans eye, which doth hinder it from diſcerning any thing vnderſtandingly. It is the reaſon wherefore God ſaid to <hi>Moyſes,</hi> that whiles we liue wee cannot ſee it cleerely; for the which alſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, That we know but in part, and S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> That we ſee the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of our God, but as it were in a glaſſe, or through a window: but when our ſoule ſhall be parted from this body, and the vaile taken away which blindeth her eyes, then ſhal it behold and ſee God face to face, then ſhal it haue the perfect knowledge of him &amp; of Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, &amp; in it eternal life. We ſhal behold that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> now we worſhip; for we ſhal enter into the Sanctuary of our Lord, and there ſhall looke on him without ceaſing, the propitiation &amp; the Cherubins: nothing neither of the law nor the Goſpell ſhal be any more vnknowne or hid from vs. God wil ſhew vnto vs as vnto his friends &amp; familiars, all the riches of his houſe; he will talke friendly with vs, &amp; wil impart all vnto
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:150422:133"/>
vr. An ancient man turning from merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, &amp; being entred into the hall where <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metriꝰ Phalereꝰ</hi> read; when he had hard him a litle while, begins to complaine, &amp; ſaid, O vnhappy man that I am, haue the good of this world bin cauſe that I haue bin ſo long depriued of ſuch good things as theſe? Let vs alſo ſay, O miſerable life, wilt thou dure much longer, wilt thou not ſhortly let vs go whither we aſpire, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the ſchoole of our God? Muſt we loſe ſo many dayes? Happy death wilt thou not haſten to bring vs thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? We ſee by theſe reaſons what occaſion we haue to feare, flie from, and complain of death, which is a reſt &amp; ſleepe moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aboue all other; for there is no noiſe nor dreames to trouble or interrupt it: it is a holſome medicine, which being ſwallowed, doth heale vs of all diſeaſes, &amp; taketh al pain from vs. Which <hi>Socrates</hi> conſidering, after he had drunke the poyſon by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Athenians, who had vniuſtly condemned him to die, when the venom was diſperſed in his members, &amp; his friend <hi>Crito</hi> a litle before he gaue vp the ghoſt, had asked him, if he would commaund him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: no, ſaid he, but that thou offer ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to <hi>Aeſculapiꝰ</hi> the god of phyſick, to giue him thankes: for I neuer tooke a medicine of ſuch great force, nor which wrought
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:150422:134"/>
better. It is a great ſhame that theſe Pagans in their ignorance and infidelity ſeeme to bee better inſtructed and more vertuous then wee are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for wee feare death and flie from it, as an euill thing, and they hold and eſteeme it as an incomparable good. <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi> at the houre of his death percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his friends about his bedde weeping, comforted them, ſaying, Reioyce O my friends, for your friend <hi>Epaminondas</hi> is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to begin to liue. Is death then an euill, which hath nothing elſe of that which we eſteeme death, but the name and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for indeed it is a life? Alſo is this life a good, which hath but the name of it, for in effect it is a very death? both the one and the other, as ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn Chryſoſtome,</hi> is masked and haue both falſe faces. Life which is ſo euill fauoured hath the faire, which maketh it to be beloued; death which is ſo faire hath the vgly, which maketh it to be feared and hated. When it preſents it ſelfe vnto vs ſo masked, at the firſt it ſeemes fearefull; but if wee put vp the maske wee ſhall finde it vnderneath ſo faire and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, that preſently wee ſhall bee inflamed with the loue of it. Let vs then take away this vaine feare of death; let vs beleeue that which is true, that it is the greateſt good
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:150422:134"/>
that can happen vnto vt. That which anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>Apollo</hi> anſwered to <hi>Pindar,</hi> being queſtioned what thing hee did eſteeme the moſt healthfull &amp; profitable to man, To die, anſwered he. It is ſaid of <hi>Cleobis</hi> and <hi>Biton,</hi> that God would recompence them for their piety, and obedience, &amp; reſpect which they had borne towards their mother. Now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing giuen them leaue to demaund what they would, they referred themſelues to his iudgement, as knowing beſt what is moſt profitable and neceſſary for vs then our ſelues: What came of it? the ſame day they died. Whereby did appeare that there is nothing more profitable vnto man, then death, by the which we are ledde into a place of pleaſure, where we begin to liue. In the olde time the Sepulchres were built in gardens, which was done not onely for to bring into our mindes our end, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our pleaſures and delights, and by that meanes to moderate them, but alſo for to inſtruct vs, that death is a conſecutiue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſure and Paradice, and is as a paſſage for to enter into a pleaſant Orchard: it is the reaſon for the which at Athens, when they buried the dead bodies, they turned their faces towards the Eaſt, and not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Weſt, to ſhew that in death our
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:150422:135"/>
life and light begins: Why doe we put our bodies in Sepulchres as in cheſts, if it be not to ſhew that they are not loſt, but layed vp as pretious veſſels of the holy Ghoſt, &amp; that in time they ſhall be taken forth, and ſhall be put into light, for the decoration of the houſe of their Lord. Theſe things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, let vs take away all feare and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of death, let vs reioyce and ſing as doe the Swannes when they are neere their death: let vs ſay with <hi>Dauid,</hi> Lord I haue beene glad when it hath beene ſaid vnto me, Goe to, let vs goe into the houſe of our Lord.</p>
                        <p>It remaines now, before we end this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Treatiſe, to ſhew how we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue our ſelues at the death of our friends, and how to mittigate the ſorrowes, which we conceiue for them, which to do we muſt conſider that which followeth.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, the vnauoidable neceſſity of al men, the which cannot be remedied neyther by counſaile nor any other meanes. <hi>Dauid</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a regard thereunto, did comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himſelfe after the death of his little childe, for whom hee had wept and prayed ſo much during his ſickeneſſe, when there was yet ſome hope to impetrate of God, by humble prayers, that he would reſtore him
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:150422:135"/>
to health: but when he ſaw that it was too late, that all teares were now vaine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, he left his mourning and began to reioyce. Ieſus Chriſt ſaith, that euery day hath afflictions enough of it ſelfe to trouble vs, without that we ſhould heape on thoſe of others, or of thoſe that are gone, renuing it by the remembrance of them; or of thoſe which are to come, anticipating by feare and coniecture. It is an inſtruction moſt neceſſary, and which we ought all to take, for the reſt and tranquillity of our mindes. Secondly, we muſt conſider whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our friends die, that it is the will of God, which doth, nor ordeyneth nothing but for the good of his children, as ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to thoſe that are loued of God, all things ſuccced &amp; turne to their profit: if we do not beleeue that, we are vnbeleeuers; if we beleeue it, we ought not to grieue for any thing that befals vs; for all is profitable to vs. Now there is no great reaſon that we ſhould hide vs from our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. The ſoueraigne wiſdome of God is cauſe that there is nothing better done then that which he doth; and his goodnes that there is nothing better; if there be nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor better done then that which he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyneth and diſpoſeth; and he diſpoſeth of vs and of our affaires, and generally of all
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:150422:136"/>
that which hapneth vnto vs, why do we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> row, why doe we deſire any thing elſe? For we cannot haue any thing that is better why do we complaine? For all is well and cannot be better done.</p>
                        <p>We muſt thirdly thinke, that to dye is a thing general and common to all: We paſſe and flye away as doth the water of a brook; and it is an act and ſtatute of our God, that we muſt dye all: if then that happen vnto vs which is common to all, is it not a great folly and pride in vs, to deſire to be exempt from the common condition, and to wiſh for a particular? What are we the worſe that our friends are dead? ſo doe thoſe of our neighbours die. <hi>Menander</hi> writing to a friend of his to comfort him, alleadged this reaſon vnto him: Thou ſhouldeſt haue, ſayth he, iuſt occaſion to grieue, if thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and deſtiny were worſe then other mens; but if it be alike, why doſt thou complain? There are more that if we would diligently conſider, and make an intire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon betweene vs and others, we ſhould finde there are an infinite many worſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned then we are. And that is true which <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> ſaid, as reporteth <hi>Valerius</hi> the great, that if it were poſſible to aſſemble all the miſeries of the world on a heape, for
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:150422:136"/>
afterwards to part them by equall portions, there is not hee but would rather chuſe his owne then his part of the whole heape. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we are not alone loſing our friends, and that if we will looke into it, wee ſhall finde that there are enough, more ill at eaſe then we: let vs content our ſelues, that ſo it pleaſeth God, and let vs not deſire immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall friends, where we ſee thoſe of others to be but mortall.</p>
                        <p>Againe, let vs thinke that it is a naturall thing to die, as it is for winter to be colde, and ſommer hote. Our bodies (ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) are mortall. Then let vs not maruell if in winter there be raine, froſt and ſnow, for the ſeaſon brings it. Let vs not maruell that the night followes the day, and that man at night after his labour goeth to ſleepe, for all that is naturall. Alſo ought not we for the ſame reaſon to be aſtonied when a man dyeth; no more, ſaith S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> then when he is borne and commeth into the world, for the one and the other is ordinary: And want of conſidering it, is cauſe oftentimes, that at the death of our friend we are ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, as if it were a thing prodigious and not accuſtomed. When newes was brought to <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> that his ſonne was dead, it moued him not at all, onely he ſaid that
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:150422:137"/>
it was not a new and vnuſuall thing that a mortall man ſhould die, and that when he begot him, he did not beget him immortall. What made him ſo conſtant, but that before hand he had foreſeene and often conſidered that it ought ſo to come to paſſe, being a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall thing?</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, we muſt conſider, that death is a tribute which we owe and are bound to pay vnto nature. Thou art duſt and earth, and to earth thou ſhalt returne, ſaith God, ſpeaking to man after he had ſinned: Then, when one of our friends dieth, why are we diſcontented? Becauſe he hath quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe and payed what he ought? If he had payed his King the tribute and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary taxe, we would approue of that as moſt right, and an obedience and duety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Prince; and if hee hath done as much to nature, what reaſon is there to grieue at it?</p>
                        <p>Againe, that in it God heareth vs; for we aske of God that his Kingdome come, and that his will be done; what doe we ieſt with God, asking him that which we would not haue, and feare to obtaine? and doe vexe our ſelues, and murmure, in ſtead of giuing him thankes when he hath graunted our requeſts? We ſhew well that we thinke
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:150422:137"/>
little on the prayers which wee make: for if wee thought vpon them, eyther we would not pray ſo, or elſe in praying ſo if God grant our requeſt, we would not be ſory for it.</p>
                        <p>Againe, that when our friendes die we loſe them not; for our Lord whoſe they are both before and after death, is not the God of the dead but of the liuing. <hi>Cirus</hi> ſpeaking to his friends before his death, for to comfort them, ſaid; Doe not thinke when I ſhall be dead that I am loſt, or ſhall come to nothing. When we ſow a land, the graines of corne are not loſt, they rotte therein, but it is the better to fructifie; ſo are our bodies in the earth, for to reuiue one day, and to riſe againe in incorruption, immortality, glory and vertue. When alſo a man goeth a long &amp; tedious iourny, do we thinke him loſt? when any one of our friends is at the Court with his Prince, who will not ſuffer him to depart out of his company, raiſed to honour, and prouided of great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, are wee ſory for it? Why then are we ſory for a friend whom wee know aſſuredly to bee in the houſe of God, in honour and credite, and ſo well at eaſe, that he would not change for all the felicity of this world? Againe, that it is a
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:150422:138"/>
very vnhoneſt and vnſeemely thing in a faithfull man to greeue ſo immoderately and as if hee were deſperate. A Chriſtian ought to haue a ſtrength and courage, which ſhould be inuincible againſt all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, and euen againſt the gates of hell: he ſhould be like a building grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a firme rocke, that may hold firme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the ſtormes, waues and windes, and all the inconueniences wherewith he may be aſſayled; he muſt not be ſoft, and yeelde preſently to aduerſity, melting in teares, and therein drowning (as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaide) his bedde. The Liciens in time paſt had a law, by the which it was ordeyned that whoſoeuer would weepe for the death of his friend, ſhould put on womens clothes, to ſhew that that it is more anſwering to a cowardly and effeminate heate, then to a manly courage. And as it happens in mens bodies, that when they are tender and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, they cannot endure the colde in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor yet the heate in ſummer; ſo may we iudge of ſuch courages, that if they cannot beare aduerſity without impatience, no more can they proſperity without inſolency.</p>
                        <p>We muſt finally conſider, that by the teares and complaints which we vſe at the death of our friends, we doe not remedie
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:150422:138"/>
our ſelues, no more then doth the ſicke man his diſeaſe by his ſighes, but rather doth encreaſe his miſery. And we may ſay that euen as by common experience, and the reports of Phyſitions, wee ſee in cholericke folkes, that the more they anger themſelues the more their rage and choler doth aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: alſo in the mournfull and heauy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that continuing in their teares and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, their ſorrow doth grow and ſtrengthen. So ſaid an ancient Philoſopher to <hi>Arcinoe,</hi> to comfort her; If, ſayd he, thou loueſt teares they wil loue thee reciprocally, and as friends will alwayes frequent and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company thee: What then doth this great mourning profit vs, if not to make vs more miſerable? I, but will ſome ſay, in excuſing themſelues, it is a naturall thing to weepe at ſuch an accident: I agree to it, neyther will I condemne a moderate ſorrow. As a certaine man ſaw an auncient Philoſopher weeping for the death of his ſonne, and did reproue his inconſtancy: he anſwered him very well, ſaying, Good friend, ſuffer me to be a man. We muſt not be like Barbarians or ſauage beaſtes without humanity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affection, without pitty nor feeling. I wiſh, ſayth <hi>Pindar,</hi> not to be ſicke, but if I am, I would not be without feeling; for it is
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:150422:139"/>
an euill ſigne, when in our ſickeneſſe we are dull and feele nothing. Then when in our mourning we ſhall keepe the meane, and ſhall auoyde the two extremes, which S. <hi>Baſil</hi> doth condemne as vitious, to wit, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotrijnon &amp; thiriodian,</hi> which is, that we be not Stoikes, that is to ſay, without affection, nor ſoft on the other ſide, to ſuffer our ſelues to be wonne and ouercome with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; I doe approue, that if we ſhew our ſelues men in weeping, let vs alſo ſhew that we are Chriſtians furniſhed with hope in correcting and moderating our ſorrowes. Others ſay, I loued them ſo dearely. If thou louedſt him ſo dearely as thou ſayeſt, ſhew it and reioyce at his happineſſe and reſt: I rather beleeue that that which cauſeth in vs this great mourning, is the loue which we haue of our ſelues, which is the cauſe that we greeue at the loſſe of our friends, not for the reſpect which we haue to them, but to our ſelues, being diſcontent to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the pleaſure and conſolations which they gaue vs. Which Ieſus Chriſt ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſeeing that they grieued that he had tolde them, that in ſhort time hee ſhould be put to death: It is not for loue of me that you are ſo heauy; for if you loued me you would be glad, for as much as it is
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:150422:139"/>
my good or happines to die. Others ſay, he was ſo honeſt a man, therfore is it that God tooke him, as he did <hi>Enocke,</hi> for feare leſt by the malice and corruption of this age, he ſhould change. When the fruit is ripe muſt it not be gathered, for feare leſt it ſhould rot on the tree?</p>
                        <p>Others ſay hee died in the prime of his age; by ſo much the happier is he: for, as ſaid <hi>Anacharſis,</hi> that ſhippe is happieſt which arriueth firſt at the port. Moreouer, there is no certaine time determined for all men to die: but as we ſee in fruit time, ſome are gathered ſooner then the others; ſo is it amongſt men. There are ſome alſo that ſay we muſt honour the dead, by mourning for them, falling into the ſuperſtition of the Iewes, who holding this opinion, did hire certaine ſingers &amp; muſitians, to ſing pittifull &amp; funeral ſongs for the death of their frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds; which Ieſus Chriſt did reproue in the houſe of the Prince of the Synagogue: &amp; not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, for it is not good in praiſe of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to mourne for it: complaints &amp; teares are rather ſignes of miſerie then any thing els. We do not now weep for the holy Martyrs, which yet we ſhould doe, if in teares there did conſiſt any honor; but we honor them by a remembrance of them, with bleſſing &amp;
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:150422:140"/>
thankeſgiuing, and by paine and ſtudy we endeauour to follow them. If likewiſe wee haue a friend whom we will honor after his death, it muſt not be with teares and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, but rather by an honorable mention which we are to make of him and of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and by a deſire which we haue to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and follow his good and laudable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion.</p>
                        <p>It is time to conclude this preſent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and to reſolue the precedent reaſons; that wee muſt neither feare nor flie from death, but rather loue and deſire it more then life, and preferre the day of our death before the day of our birth: for by our birth we come to paine and affliction, and dying we goe to God, and to a perpetuall reſt. Which the Greeks haue very fitly ſhewed vs; for in their language the day of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity is called <hi>Genethlia,</hi> that is to ſay in the ſame language, <hi>Geneſis ton athlon,</hi> and in our French tongue, beginning of troubles: and death is called <hi>Thanatos,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, according to the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Themiſte, Now vp to God.</hi> Let vs then ſtrictly examin them, &amp; iudge of them, that wee may take away the feare of the one, &amp; the exceſſiue loue of the other. God through his holy ſpirit giue vs the grace to do it. So be it.</p>

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:150422:156"/>
in the hope which he had of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of his ſoule.

                           <p>This knowledge is a great conſolation to the faithfull in all their afflictions, and doth take from them the feares of death, knowing that their ſoules being ſeparated from their bodies liue in heauen:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.</note> in which they are admoniſhed, not to ſettle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vpon the tranſitory things of this life; and not to loade their ſoules with the burthen of ſinne, to the end that dying they may bee raiſed vp towards God our Father, and IESVS CHRIST our Sauiour, vnto whom we ought with a ſtedfaſt faith recommend them.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a noted thing to all, that we muſt die; and all the faithfull ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that the Angels wait for the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of men, for to carry their ſoules into their place. The holy Angels carry away thoſe of the faithfull, according to the charge which they haue for their ſaluation, into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, and into the place of the happy; and the euill Angels thoſe of the wicked into hell.

Then the faithfull being departed, all ſuch things ceaſe; although it may happen that the faithfull ſhall be in all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity aſſaulted by Sathan, to make him fall from faith, if it were poſſible for him: but thoſe are extraordinary things, and in the meane time the Lord giueth victory to his,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 31.</note> and makes them the better to know the power of their faith, and the aſſiſtance of the holy Angels. But ordinarily that which is ſeene and heard at the departure of the wicked, is fearefull, comming from the deſtroying Angels and enemies of men, &amp; Authors of troubles; the which do all they can to bring the vnfaithfull to deſperation, and to keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in it, &amp; endeuour as much as in them lieth, to hinder and trouble the praiers of the aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: for the feare that they haue leſt their damnation ſhould bee prolo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For beſides that their bodies ſhall be horribly afflicted, their ſoules ſhall be in incredible diſtreſſes and ſorrowes. This ought wel to ſtirre vs vp to watch and pray, and to refraine from doing euill,<note place="margin">

                           <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oreouer my brethren &amp; friends it remaines, that this booke be not onely in our hands, but alſo in our hearts, and if we haue any deſire to amend ous liues, let it not be deferred till to morrow; for when to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhall come, wee will yet referre all to the next day, and ſo conſequently the whole yeare ſhall paſſe, yea our whole life.</p>
                        <p>If then at this preſent howre there bee ſome little good affection in vs, let vs not ſuffer it to be quenched, let vs not kill that grace which God hath giuen vs; but to the contrary by all meanes which ſhall be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vs, let vs endeuour our ſelues in ſuch ſort, that from howre to howre it may not onely be confirmed, but alſo augmented.</p>
                        <p>God is mercifull enough and liberall to grant vs our requeſts, but he will be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunated, not in his owne regard, but ours, for he knoweth how backward we are to pray and call vpon him, and how ſoone we are weary of it; although we ſhould deſire
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:150422:175"/>
nothing more in this world, for it is no ſmall thing to ſpeake vnto God. And which ought yet more to moue vs, is, that he doth willingly hearken vnto vs, and neuer puts backe thoſe which come vnto him,</p>
                        <p>I ſpeake this, becauſe I ſee not that by any other better meanes we can preuent confuſion, than by prayer. Surely if euer men had need of this aide, we are in great neceſſity of it, in theſe laſt daies, and olde age of the world; for we muſt not doubt but that Satan now doth ſet himſelfe in armes, perceiuing well that the howre drawes neere, that he ſhall not be able to doe that which hee hath done heretofore, and that the Sonne of God muſt be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to all creatures, and that then the perfection ought to come of the bleſſed and the finiſhing of their happineſſe, of the which hee knoweth well hee hath no part. If then for his part he ſets himſelfe forth in his ſtrength, it remaines that we ſhould do the like for vs, that wee may be furniſhed with all celeſtiall armour, and that we bee not daunted with all his plots and treacheries; for ſurely the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is in our handes, ſo that we fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and not with him, as doth almoſt all the world at this day, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:150422:176"/>
that the moſt part thinke the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for ſo they haue the name of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and be without reproch before men, who are no better then the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, they then thinke themſelues very well aſſured. Others thinke that they ſhall need but a good ſigh, (as they ſay) at the laſt howre for to blot out all the reſt of their life paſſed, and preſently to tranſport them into the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; but who hath aſſured them that God will giue them the grace to make that ſigh, and to haue a true repentance of their ſins, at the howre of their death? Where haue they had pattents and good aſſurance, that they ſhall not die a ſudden death? Is not that to mocke God openly? If that may ſerue, verily S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles ſhould haue bene much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to labour and to toyle ſo much, and to beare ſo grieuous a Croſſe, if it were ſo eaſie a matter to enter into the kingdome of heauen; I meane, by the meanes which thoſe Libertines doe pretend.</p>
                        <p>Let vs aſſure our ſelues that the way is ſtraite which leadeth to ſaluation, and that there are few that go therein. Theſe words are no lies, but I pray God that we may not experiment the truth of them, to our great paine and griefe. I know well that the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:150422:176"/>
of our God is incomprehenſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, but it is towards his ſeruants, it is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that feare and reuerence him.</p>
                        <p>Beſides I know that among the children and ſeruants of God, there are many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, euen a great imperfection in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and iuſtice, and which endures till death; but there is a great difference between your life, O worldlings, and the life of the elect of God. The iuſt man ſinneth ſeuen times a day; but he ſhall be raiſed ſeuen times. Now you continue in your euill, and goe to bed with your ſinne as with your friend and companion.</p>
                        <p>Men will ſay an <hi>Aue Marie,</hi> beat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues on the breaſt, or perhaps will haue ſome diſtaſte of their ſinne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But if we neerely looke into all, we ſhall finde that it is nothing but meere hypocriſie. If our friend or kinſmen dies, if we looſe our goods, if wrong or iniury be offered vnto vs, if our good name be taken away, if we be ſtricken or hurt, behold we are preſently in choller, or very extremely ſad, our hearts euen cloſed vp with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; but if our ſpirit dies, and if we looſe the euerlaſting riches by our tranſgreſſion, we make no account of it, we are not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with it, we grieue more for the loſſe of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:150422:177"/>
this world, which is nothing, then we doe for the loſſe of God, which is all.</p>
                        <p>In ſeeing all which, cannot ſuch men yet feele their griefe? can they not yet know how much the opinion which they haue of their vertue and prudence is vaine and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous? Can they not ſee how farre they are from their reckoning? Certainly the world is full of ſuch people that haue no feeling of their ſinne, but the propheſies muſt needs be accompliſhed, to the end when the Sonne of man ſhall come, he may finde no faith vpon the earth: Verily this howre commeth on a pace, the ſignes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are very manifeſt. But becauſe we ſhould not bee diſmaid, ſeeing ſuch a danger round about vs, let vs be ſure that the Lord will bee with vs till the end of the world, prouided that our Lampes be burning, and in ſteed that the wicked euery day ſhall be worſe and worſe, for our parts let vs ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to goe forward in all holineſſe and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. I know well, that they will mocke at vs, and at our ſimplicity, that we ſhall be caſt out of their companies. But we ſhall be exalted of God, and receiued of the moſt bleſſed aſſembly.</p>
                        <p>VVherefore let vs with all patience waite for the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:150422:177"/>
and let vs labour that ſo we may be found of him without ſpot, and without reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Surely that day ought to be very feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the wicked, but as for vs we ought ſo much the rather deſire it, knowing for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that there is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation for thoſe that are in Ieſus Chriſt; knowing well the great goodneſſe and kindneſſe of him which is to come, with whom God grant wee may liue for euer and euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                           <p>ALas when ſhall wee come before the face of God our Father, and when ſhall we haue a dwelling in his houſe, and vntill when ſhall we be in this exile, wherunto by ſinne we haue bin regenerate? But how ſhall the ſinner co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt before this great God? How ſhall this poore fleſh be able to go vp into this heauenly &amp; euerlaſting Paradiſe? O how vncertaine ſhould our hope be if we had not the true promiſes of our God, &amp; how miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhould we be, if we did relie vpon our ſelues? But O great God, thou wilt that all things be poſſible to beleeuers, for the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers do truſt only thy promiſe, &amp; in thy mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy. Do not then O Lord regard ſo many ſins which are in vs. Remember rather that we are thy creatures, &amp; the worke of thy hands.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:150422:178"/>
VVe are vnworthy to be called thy children, but it pleaſeth thee to be our Father; It was thy will that thy Sonne Ieſus ſhould come downe to vs here beneath, to make that we ſhould go vp to thee. We feare not death O Lord; for thou haſt promiſed to bee with vs; death loſt her ſtrength, when thy deere Sonne died, ſo that when our bodies ſhall be knawne with wormes in the ſepulcher, our ſoules ſhall reioyce in heauen with the holy Angels. We deſire then to die to ſee thy amiable and glorious face, to liue with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt out head. O our God open vs then the gates of thy Kingdome. Cauſe vs to heare that ſweet ſpeech which was ſpoken to the poore theefe vpon the croſſe, which is, This day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe. Alas Lord we are vnworthy of it; but thy mercy and thy promiſes do giue vs aſſurance. Giue vs alſo O heauenly Father, the ſtrength to perſeuer, and deſire the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall and glorious life to come, which thou haſt purchaſed for vs, through thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, to whom with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the holy Ghoſt, be all honour, praiſe and glory for euermore.
